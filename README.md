Project Description 
This Tetris game demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, modularity, hierarchy, composition, reuse, subtype information hiding, abstraction, and exception handling. The user-friendly GUI is designed using Swing and AWT.
The project adopts the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate the game's logic, user interface, and control flow. This structure enhances maintainability and scalability while promoting code reusability.
The game features smooth gameplay with multi-threading to ensure real-time movement of the falling tetrominoes. It includes a variety of tetromino shapes, dynamic scoring, and an exciting "bomb" piece that clears the board when used. The controls are simple and responsive, making the game easy to play while maintaining a challenge as the speed of the falling pieces increases.
This implementation not only provides a fun gaming experience but also serves as a practical example of applying OOP concepts and design patterns in a Java project, showcasing modular and maintainable code.
 

How To Play 
It functions like a typical Tetris game, in that a piece (tetromino) gradually falls down from the top of the screen (one at a time) and the player controls the position in which it falls. Your goal is to fill up complete lines in the board's grid. You score points each time you fill up 1 line, at which time the line will clear from the grid. There is a bonus "bomb" piece that clears the board.

Running steps:
•	Compile all folders using javac command.
•	Run Game class.
•	Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to play.

*Note: The High Score gets saved within 1 run of the program, with multiple re-plays using the same window. If you quit out and re-run the application, the high score does not get saved. As your score increases, the pieces will move down incrementally faster to make the game more difficult.
